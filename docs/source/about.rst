About the project
================================================================

The Event Sourcing Framework is a robust Python-based tool designed to simplify the implementation of the event sourcing pattern in application development. 

This framework not only captures the state changes of an application as a sequence of events but also provides extensive functionalities for projections and snapshots, enhancing the system's performance and scalability. 

Customization lies at the core of this framework, offering developers a wide range of options to tailor event handling, storage solutions, and data processing to meet specific requirements. 

With its comprehensive features and flexibility, this framework aims to empower developers to build highly responsive and resilient systems, making it an ideal choice for projects that require detailed auditing, complex state management, or historical data analysis.
